UniProt comprises four major components, each optimized for different uses, the UniProt Archive, the UniProt Knowledgebase, the UniProt Reference Clusters and the UniProt Metagenomic and Environmental Sequence Database. UniProt is produced by the UniProt Consortium, which consists of groups from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB) and the Protein Information Resource (PIR). UniProt is updated and distributed every 4 weeks and can be accessed online for searches or downloads.},

    abstract ={GenBank® (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) is a comprehensive database that contains publicly available nucleotide sequences for almost 260 000 formally described species. These sequences are obtained primarily through submissions from individual laboratories and batch submissions from large-scale sequencing projects, including whole-genome shotgun (WGS) and environmental sampling projects. Most submissions are made using the web-based BankIt or standalone Sequin programs, and GenBank staff assigns accession numbers upon data receipt. Daily data exchange with the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) ensures worldwide coverage. GenBank is accessible through the NCBI Entrez retrieval system, which integrates data from the major DNA and protein sequence databases along with taxonomy, genome, mapping, protein structure and domain information, and the biomedical journal literature via PubMed. BLAST provides sequence similarity searches of GenBank and other sequence databases. Complete bimonthly releases and daily updates of the GenBank database are available by FTP.

    abstract ={The DNA data bank of Japan (DDBJ, http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp) maintains a primary nucleotide sequence database and provides analytical resources for biological information to researchers. This database content is exchanged with the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) within the framework of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC). Resources provided by the DDBJ include traditional nucleotide sequence data released in the form of 27 316 452 entries or 16 876 791 557 base pairs (as of June 2012), and raw reads of new generation sequencers in the sequence read archive (SRA). A Japanese researcher published his own genome sequence via DDBJ-SRA on 31 July 2012. To cope with the ongoing genomic data deluge, in March 2012, our computer previous system was totally replaced by a commodity cluster-based system that boasts 122.5 TFlops of CPU capacity and 5 PB of storage space. During this upgrade, it was considered crucial to replace and refactor substantial portions of the DDBJ software systems as well. As a result of the replacement process, which took more than 2 years to perform, we have achieved significant improvements in system performance.},

	year = {2007}, 
	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btm189}, 
	abstract ={Motivation: A few years ago, FlyBase undertook to design a new database schema to store Drosophila data. It would fully integrate genomic sequence and annotation data with bibliographic, genetic, phenotypic and molecular data from the literature representing a distillation of the first 100 years of research on this major animal model system. In developing this new integrated schema, FlyBase also made a commitment to ensure that its design was generic, extensible and available as open source, so that it could be employed as the core schema of any model organism data repository, thereby avoiding redundant software development and potentially increasing interoperability. Our question was whether we could create a relational database schema that would be successfully reused.Results: Chado is a relational database schema now being used to manage biological knowledge for a wide variety of organisms, from human to pathogens, especially the classes of information that directly or indirectly can be associated with genome sequences or the primary RNA and protein products encoded by a genome. Biological databases that conform to this schema can interoperate with one another, and with application software from the Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) toolkit. Chado is distinctive because its design is driven by ontologies. The use of ontologies (or controlled vocabularies) is ubiquitous across the schema, as they are used as a means of typing entities. The Chado schema is partitioned into integrated subschemas (modules), each encapsulating a different biological domain, and each described using representations in appropriate ontologies. To illustrate this methodology, we describe here the Chado modules used for describing genomic sequences.Availability: GMOD is a collaboration of several model organism database groups, including FlyBase, to develop a set of open-source software for managing model organism data. The Chado schema is freely distributed under the terms of the Artistic License (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license.php) from GMOD (www.gmod.org).Contact: cjm@fruitfly.org or emmert@morgan.harvard.edu.},

  title = {Nested Containment List {(NCList):} A new algorithm for accelerating
	interval query of genome alignment and interval databases},
  journal = {Bioinformatics},
  year = {2007},
  pages = {btl647},
  abstract = {Motivation: The exponential growth of sequence databases poses a major
	challenge to bioinformatics tools for querying alignment and annotation
	databases. There is a pressing need for methods for finding overlapping
	sequence intervals that are highly scalable to database size, query
	interval size, result size, and construction / updating of the interval
	database. Results: We have developed a new interval database representation,
	the Nested Containment List {(NCList),} whose query time is O(n +
	log N), where N is the database size and n is the size of the result
	set. In all cases tested this query algorithm is 5 -500 fold faster
	than other indexing methods tested in this study, such as {MySQL}
	mult-column indexing, {MySQL} binning, and {R-Tree} indexing. We
	provide performance comparisons both in simulated datasets and real-world
	genome alignment databases, across a wide range of data-base sizes
	and query interval widths. We also present an in-place {NCList} construction
	algorithm that yields database construction times that are approximately
	100-fold faster than other methods available. The {NCList} data structure
	appears to provide a useful foundation for highly scalable interval
	database applications. Availability: {NCList} data structure is part
	of Pygr, a bioinformatics graph database library, available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/pygr},
