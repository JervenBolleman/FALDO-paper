@article{RINGS,
	Abstract = {In the bioinformatics field, many computer algorithmic and data mining technologies have been developed for gene prediction, protein--protein interaction analysis, sequence analysis, and protein folding predictions, to name a few. This kind of research has branched off from the genomics field, creating the transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and glycomics research areas in the postgenomic age. In the glycomics field, given the complexity of glycan structures with their branches of monosaccharides in various conformations, new data mining and algorithmic methods have been developed in an attempt to gain a better understanding of glycans. However, these methods have not all been implemented as tools such that the glycobiology community may utilize them in their research. Thus, we have developed RINGS (Resource for INformatics of Glycomes at Soka) as a freely available Web resource for glycobiologists to analyze their data using the latest data mining and algorithmic techniques. It provides a number of tools including a 2D glycan drawing and querying interface called DrawRINGS, a Glycan Pathway Predictor (GPP) tool for dynamically computing the N-glycan biosynthesis pathway from a given glycan structure, and data mining tools Glycan Miner Tool and Profile PSTMM. These tools and other utilities provided by RINGS will be described. The URL for RINGS is http://rings.t.soka.ac.jp/.},

@article{Genbank2013,
	Abstract = {GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) is a comprehensive database that contains publicly available nucleotide sequences for almost 260 000 formally described species. These sequences are obtained primarily through submissions from individual laboratories and batch submissions from large-scale sequencing projects, including whole-genome shotgun (WGS) and environmental sampling projects. Most submissions are made using the web-based BankIt or standalone Sequin programs, and GenBank staff assigns accession numbers upon data receipt. Daily data exchange with the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) ensures worldwide coverage. GenBank is accessible through the NCBI Entrez retrieval system, which integrates data from the major DNA and protein sequence databases along with taxonomy, genome, mapping, protein structure and domain information, and the biomedical journal literature via PubMed. BLAST provides sequence similarity searches of GenBank and other sequence databases. Complete bimonthly releases and daily updates of the GenBank database are available by FTP.

@article{DDBJ2013,
	Abstract = {The DNA data bank of Japan (DDBJ, http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp) maintains a primary nucleotide sequence database and provides analytical resources for biological information to researchers. This database content is exchanged with the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) within the framework of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC). Resources provided by the DDBJ include traditional nucleotide sequence data released in the form of 27 316 452 entries or 16 876 791 557 base pairs (as of June 2012), and raw reads of new generation sequencers in the sequence read archive (SRA). A Japanese researcher published his own genome sequence via DDBJ-SRA on 31 July 2012. To cope with the ongoing genomic data deluge, in March 2012, our computer previous system was totally replaced by a commodity cluster-based system that boasts 122.5 TFlops of CPU capacity and 5 PB of storage space. During this upgrade, it was considered crucial to replace and refactor substantial portions of the DDBJ software systems as well. As a result of the replacement process, which took more than 2 years to perform, we have achieved significant improvements in system performance.},

@article{Chado2007,
	Abstract = {Motivation: A few years ago, FlyBase undertook to design a new database schema to store Drosophila data. It would fully integrate genomic sequence and annotation data with bibliographic, genetic, phenotypic and molecular data from the literature representing a distillation of the first 100 years of research on this major animal model system. In developing this new integrated schema, FlyBase also made a commitment to ensure that its design was generic, extensible and available as open source, so that it could be employed as the core schema of any model organism data repository, thereby avoiding redundant software development and potentially increasing interoperability. Our question was whether we could create a relational database schema that would be successfully reused.Results: Chado is a relational database schema now being used to manage biological knowledge for a wide variety of organisms, from human to pathogens, especially the classes of information that directly or indirectly can be associated with genome sequences or the primary RNA and protein products encoded by a genome. Biological databases that conform to this schema can interoperate with one another, and with application software from the Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) toolkit. Chado is distinctive because its design is driven by ontologies. The use of ontologies (or controlled vocabularies) is ubiquitous across the schema, as they are used as a means of typing entities. The Chado schema is partitioned into integrated subschemas (modules), each encapsulating a different biological domain, and each described using representations in appropriate ontologies. To illustrate this methodology, we describe here the Chado modules used for describing genomic sequences.Availability: GMOD is a collaboration of several model organism database groups, including FlyBase, to develop a set of open-source software for managing model organism data. The Chado schema is freely distributed under the terms of the Artistic License (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license.php) from GMOD (www.gmod.org).Contact: cjm@fruitfly.org or emmert@morgan.harvard.edu.},

@article{NCL2007,
	Abstract = {Motivation: The exponential growth of sequence databases poses a major
	challenge to bioinformatics tools for querying alignment and annotation
	databases. There is a pressing need for methods for finding overlapping
	sequence intervals that are highly scalable to database size, query
	interval size, result size, and construction / updating of the interval
	database. Results: We have developed a new interval database representation,
	the Nested Containment List {(NCList),} whose query time is O(n +
	log N), where N is the database size and n is the size of the result
	set. In all cases tested this query algorithm is 5 -500 fold faster
	than other indexing methods tested in this study, such as {MySQL}
	mult-column indexing, {MySQL} binning, and {R-Tree} indexing. We
	provide performance comparisons both in simulated datasets and real-world
	genome alignment databases, across a wide range of data-base sizes
	and query interval widths. We also present an in-place {NCList} construction
	algorithm that yields database construction times that are approximately
	100-fold faster than other methods available. The {NCList} data structure
	appears to provide a useful foundation for highly scalable interval
	database applications. Availability: {NCList} data structure is part
	of Pygr, a bioinformatics graph database library, available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/pygr},

@article{Lutteke01052006,
	Abstract = {The development of glycan-related databases and bioinformatics applications is considerably lagging behind compared with the wealth of available data and software tools in genomics and proteomics. Because the encoding of glycan structures is more complex, most of the bioinformatics approaches cannot be applied to glycan structures. No standard procedures exist where glycan structures found in various species, organs, tissues or cells can be routinely deposited. In this article the concepts of the GLYCOSCIENCES.de portal are described. It is demonstrated how an efficient structure-based cross-linking of various glycan-related data originating from different resources can be accomplished using a single user interface. The structure oriented retrieval options{\~N}exact structure, substructure, motif, composition and sugar components{\~N}are discussed. The types of available data{\~N}references, composition, spatial structures, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shifts (experimental and estimated), theoretically calculated fragments and Protein Database (PDB) entries{\~N}are exemplified for Man3. The free availability and unrestricted use of glycan-related data is an absolute prerequisite to efficiently share distributed resources. Additionally, there is an urgent need to agree to a generally accepted exchange format as well as to a common software interface. An open access repository for glyco-related experimental data will secure that the loss of primary data will be considerably reduced.},
