\section*{Results}
One of the practical goal driving the development of FALDO was to be able
to represent all the annotated sequences in UniProt and the INSDC as RDF
triples, as a step towards providing this data via SPARQL end points whereby
it can be queried.
UniProt is already available as RDF, and a revised version of the full
dataset using FALDO has already tested and is expected to be included
in the UniProt XXX release \textit{TODO - fill in version and data}.

The protein examples considered, such as the UniProt feature annotations,
require relatively simple locations within protein sequences to be described.
There are corner cases for situations like unknown boundaries.
\textit{TODO - examples - how about cysteine bonds in PDB data?}.

Nucleotide data from the INSDC can require considerably more complicated
sequence regions, both in terms of ambiguous end points, and the need for
various compound locations.
\textit{TODO - examples}.

All of the UniProt protein sequences are now available in RDF format,
with a SPARQL end point currently in beta. Converting more recent
curated INSDC data has been straightforward, however there are a
number of deprecated location strings which have been problematic.
\textit{TODO - examples? manual curation to fix last few oddities?}
