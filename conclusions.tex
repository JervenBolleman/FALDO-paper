\section*{Conclusions}
FALDO is a simple and minimalistic ontology for describing biological features in a consistent manner that Bio-informaticians can depend upon.
The diverse software and databases using FALDO show that it has enough power to describe all biological feature positions.
It is now much easier for users querying biological databases on the semantic web to compare features on the basis of locations.
This also means that visualisation tools that access position data via SPARQL can easily reuse significant parts of queries between databases.
