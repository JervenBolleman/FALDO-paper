\section*{Conclusions}
FALDO is a small ontology for describing biological features in a consistent manner that bioinformaticians can depend upon.
The diverse software and high-profile databases already using FALDO show that it has enough power to describe existing biological feature locations.
The uptake of this ontology means that it is now much easier for users querying biological databases on the Semantic Web to compare features on the basis of locations.
This also means that visualisation tools that access positional data via SPARQL can easily reuse significant parts of queries between databases.
